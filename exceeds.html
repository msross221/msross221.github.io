    <h2><center>Voter Categories and Divisions by Voter Education and Voter Income</center></h2>
    <center><iframe src="categories.html" width="1000px" height="500px:" frameBorder="0"></iframe></center>
    <center><p>This parallel categories plot shows the relationship between how often a voter votes (voter category), 
        the level of education of that voter, and the income category of that voter. As shown in the visualization,
        the majority of voters who always vote <b>have a college education</b> and make <b>above $75k</b> a year. 
        There is a different pattern shown for voters who rarely or never vote. The majority of these voters 
        have a <b>high school education or less</b> and <b>make less than $40k</b> a year. There is <b>no clear pattern</b> for people who
        vote sporadically.</p></center>

    <h2><center>Percent of Voter Turnout and Percent of Absentee Voters</center></h2>
    <center><iframe src="bubble.html" width="1000px" height="500px:" frameBorder="0"></iframe></center>
    <center><p>This bubble plot shows the relationship between voter turnout and the percent of voters who
        used absentee ballots over time between 2014 and 2022. Generally, <b>voter turnout increases over time,
        as does the percent of voters who vote absentee</b>. <b>2022 is the year with the most notable change in the percent
        of voters voting absentee</b>. In 2016 and 2022 there were congressional and presidential
        elections, which is reflected in a higher percent of voter turnout in those years.</p></center>

    <h2><center>What does voter turnout look like in Virginia cities and counties in the 2022 Virginia general election?</center></h2>
    <center><iframe src = "map.html" width = "1000px" height = "500px:" frameBorder = "0"></iframe></center>
    <center><p>As shown by the map, there is generally <b>higher voter turnout in counties that are in the northern and 
        eastern</b> part of Virginia. The <b>western most counties have the lowest voter turnout</b>. Furthermore, it appears
        that cities tend to have higher voter turnout than counties do.</p></center>

        <h2><center>Exceeding Expectations</center></h2>
        <center><p>In order to exceed expectations, I altered a few things regarding the formatting of the document.
            My knowledge of html outside what we covered in class is very minimal, so I kept the edits simple. I bolded important 
            information in the analyses of the three visualizations. I also made sure that the visualizations and  text 
            were  centered in the page. Lastly, I added breaks in between the texts and visualizations to make the text
            easier  to read. I believe that these edits made it easier to read the  html  document.
